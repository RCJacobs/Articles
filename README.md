Bitcoin is the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency in
existence, its name synonymous with both block chain technology and
decentralized payments.  As legions of “alt-coins”
enter the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin remains the largest and most
influential of the pack. What makes Bitcoin so popular is the technology it is
built upon, a decentralized block chain which allows transactions to occur
without the need of a central authority through consensus on the block chain
ledger. The immutable nature of the block chain makes it secure, powerful, and
allows it’s users process transactions without the need of an intermediary such
as a major bank. 

Recently the increase in public interest, the rise in the
cryptocurrency market cap, and increased adoption have caught the interest of
governments and regulatory bodies worldwide.  This has introduced a layer of uncertainty and
overall fear in the cryptocurrency market place. One of the block chain’s
biggest perks has become a major sticking point for many of its users. Outside
of a personal randomized wallet address, everything that takes place on the
Bitcoin block chain is public and easily accessible. Both the point of origin,
the end point, and the transaction amount are publically available to anyone
willing to look, including government regulators. 

Enter Bitcoin Private.

Bitcoin Private is Bitcoin’s logical next step, and improves
upon both Bitcoin’s now sluggish usage and implements additional protections
for both the sender and the recipient. Building upon its namesake, Bitcoin
Private offers faster block times and enables users to generate both
transparent and private addresses. This additional security allows users to
store value with confidence and for the first time allows users to remain
totally anonymous during transactions. No more paranoia about moving funds or disclosing
your holdings when authorizing a transfer. Bitcoin Private is updated to meet
the demands of serious investors and end users alike, and is maintained by a
community who supports the ideology of cryptocurrency as a whole. 

Cryptocurrency gains more attention every day and its usage
is only increasing, this is evidenced not only by the rise its notoriety but
the overall increase in market capitalization and transaction volume. Regulatory
bodies and financial institutions are beginning to recognize the legitimacy of
Bitcoin, the time for improvement and increased user protection is now. Bitcoin
Private is the way forward.
